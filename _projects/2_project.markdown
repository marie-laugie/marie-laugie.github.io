        Source rock formation first prerequisite is the deposition of organic-rich sediments. Three major factors control the richness of sediments in organic carbon that are (1)         production, (2) preservation and (3) dilution or concentration by clastic inputs. Earth System Modeling allows to estimate these three parameters by simulating marine             productivity and carbon export, oceanic dissolved oxygen, and run-off. The comparison of modeling results with measured TOC values in well-data allows to calibrate the             model and to become predictive in unexplored frontier areas.
